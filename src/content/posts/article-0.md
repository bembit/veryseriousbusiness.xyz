Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

<p>this is a paragraph</p>

## What I've accomplished

**Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

**Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

**Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

<h2 class="markdown-heading">What I'll learn next</h2>

<ul class="markdown-list">
    <li>I will continue to learn Astro and build my website.</li>
    <li>I will also add more posts to my blog.</li>
</ul>

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
