                <h2>this blog</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We have a lot of cool tech blogs out there. I wanted something different.</li>
                    <li>I realized I quite like debugging frontend things back in 2019. Ever since I wanted to share them,
                        but I never had the time, or the balls to start it.</li>
                    <li>Since it's 2024 and most 18+ year old girls having OnlyFans accounts is completely normal, I might be able to get away with blogging about a few frontend issues.</li>
                    <li>This is not going to be a "hey look, padding is 10px instead of 12px, so lame" nitpicking, ranting blog. Maybe a little. Occasionally.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>bence</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>IT Generalist, nerd.</li>
                    <li>A friend of mine showed me this Python thing more than a decade ago.</li> 
                    <li>In a way he single-handedly ruined my life and I hold him responsible for being here now.</li>
                    <li>I find frontend to be more exciting than backend. From colors to caching there are a lot of fun things to explore.</li>
                    <li>I'm the first ever person who used caching and fun in the same sentence.</li>
                    <li>We are not going to touch caching here.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>something important</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not targeting devs here. It's strictly business.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What else could I do?</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Snipe typos on GitHub?</li>
                    <li>Write dev.to chatGPT articles on how to install React?</li>
                    <li>Or.. become a LinkedIn influencer?</li>
                </ul>
